# SCons D Experiment

This repository is really a playground for trying out ideas for extending the SCons tools. It is a place to
try things out before putting things into my clone of the mainline Mercurial SCons repository
([see here](https://bitbucket.org/russel/scons )) prior to creating pull requests.

Currently this repository has copies of ldc.py, dmd.py, and gdc.py from the Mercurial repository just in
case some experimentation is needed. Evolution of these will though normally be done in the Mercurial
repository itself using multiple heads on the default branch using bookmarks â€“ like Git feature branches
only different.

The main experiment at the moment is Dub support for SCons in dub.py. A first draft of the tool is written
and works for the author, but there are no tests.  Tests have to be written before there is any possibility
of getting it into the SCons mainline, hence the work here.

## Installation

### Linux, UNIX, and MacOS

The canonical way of installing tools form this repository is to clone this repository and then put symbolic links to the
files you want to use (and also DCommon.py if you are using dmd.py, ldc.py, or gdc.py from here) in either
<project-root>/site\_scons/site\_tools for use with a single project, or ~/.scons/site\_scons/site\_tools
for use with all your projects.

A pair of scripts are in the repository to automate the installation and un-installation of all files to the personal
SCons tools directory for use with all your projets: setup.sh and teardown.sh. Clone this repository and run
setup.sh and it should do the right thing so the tools in this repository are used instead of the built-in SCons
ones. Running teardown.sh should reverse this. Most of the time though people will want to be more selective and
just make links to files manually. The scripts can guide you what to do.

If things aren't working for you please email me.

### Windows
